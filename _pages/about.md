My name is Matt Wolffe, and I'm currently a student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA, where I am studying computer science.
My fascination with computer hardware and software germinated at a very young age, and in my teens I began building computers both for myself and family members, and also
for sale through word of mouth and online. By my senior year I had a collection of machines participating in distributed computing projects such as
[Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en), [SETI@Home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/), and [GIMPS](https://www.mersenne.org/)
Beginning in high school I self-taught C++ out of a beat-up old textbook my high school's CS teacher lent me in response to my quick progression through the basic curriculum.

I am most proficient in Java & Python. I am refamiliarizing myself with C/C++, and learning more Javascript/starting to learn Max MSP. I have experience with SQL, and HTML/CSS, but no formal training in the latter (taking Web-Dev currently).

Interests in Computing
------
<ul>
    <li>Quantum computing</li>
    <li>Software for musicians such as DAW's, instrument virtualization, notation software, etc.</li>
    <li>Computer science pedagogy</li>
    <li>Writing software that can begin to bridge the gap in outcomes for individuals disenfranchised by structural violence</li>
    <li>Distributed Computing Systems like the projects mentioned above</li>
    <li>Learning management systems/software as productive educational tools</li>
    <li>Applications of CS in the fields of chemistry, mathematics, music, and cosmology</li>
    <li>Ethical concerns of Large Language Models</li>
</ul>

Music
------
I am a classically trained musician, having performed and studied music for nearly two decades. I studied low-brass performance for several years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I had been awarded the Kenan Music Scholarship in 2014. 
I studied under retired principal trombonist of the North Carolina Symphony, Michael Kris. I play bass & contrabass tubas, [Cimbasso](https://cso.org/experience/article/3130/whats-a-cimbasso), euphonium, & bass trombone. 
Thanks to Professor Kris I was able to make a foray into the world of historically informed performance, learning how to play and perform on instruments such as the [Ophicleide](http://www.contrabass.com/pages/ophicleide.html) and [Bass Sackbut](https://caslabs.case.edu/medren/renaissance-instruments/sackbut-renaissance/). I have traveled extensively to supplement my studies by taking lessons with principal performers in orchestras throughout Europe and the eastern United States. I did not, however, complete my degree at UNC due to rather serious burgeoning health issues.

Educational Work
------
I currently work as a tutor/teaching assistant in and around the Shenandoah Valley area. I cover college-level courses in chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and others. I thoroughly enjoy teaching, and hope to one day be able to work as a professor.
In the past I have provided inexpensive private tuba and euphonium lessons to students who enjoy music making, but are unsure of whether they wish to study formally.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
