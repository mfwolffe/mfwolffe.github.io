<h2 class="larger-heading">Fractal Art with Python</h2>
<p class="brief">Volunteer | 2023-10-2</p>

<p>
  Volunteered to assist with <a class="noul" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/index.html">Dr. Michael Lam's</a> "Fractal Art with Python" field trip with a local middle school. Students were walked through important CS concepts by Dr. Lam and given boilerplate code to modify to solve tasks. By the end of the activity students were creating unique art by modifying provided algorithms for famous fractals or starting from scratch!
